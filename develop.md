# Todo

1. Port to python 3 [x]
2. Separate  control logic, model logic with data acces logic and view logic
3. Extract useful classes to make this usable outside Web context.
4. Port to Flask ? Though cutely we could keep CGI.
5. Probably stop using regexp to parse XML.
6. Modernize libraries etc.

python3 -m http.server --bind localhost --cgi 8000
